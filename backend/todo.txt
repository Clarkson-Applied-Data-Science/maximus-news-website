Things to do to implement the audio:
- Add a section to the landing table for the mp3 file
- Update the app.py procedure
    - Rewrite it to remove the landing object, basically remove linear dependencies (outside of app.py)
    - Call the mp3 file
    - Set the refresh function on a timer
    - Create an endpoint that simply calls the data from the db and populates the react app
- Add a button to listen to the mp3 file on the react app

Other things to do before publishing v1:
- Remove the account stuff
- Containerize the app
- Host it on a python runtime, add it to my digital ocean instances
