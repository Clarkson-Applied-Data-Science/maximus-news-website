# The Daily Byte


### Overview

[The Daily Byte](http://maximus-powers.com:5065) is a dynamic news aggregator project, showcasing the power of AI in transforming traditional content into a flexible and multimodal experience. Everyday morning this website fetches news articles, then uses AI not just to curate and rework the content, but to blend it into a single page, seamless, one-stop-shop.


### What's Inside

**News Aggregation**: Concise, AI-rewritten news summaries from various sources.

**AI-Powered Podcast**: A janky feature where AI scripts read out news articles.

**Dall-E 3 Imagery**: The Daily Byte generates one image per day to go alongside the top news story.
